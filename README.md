#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
**- Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.**
**- It is important in the technology industry in that it enables the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
**1) The establishment of software engineering in the 1960s
2) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3) The rise of agile methodolies in the 2000s**

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**> Requirements - It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.**
**> Design - The creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.**
**> Implementation - This phase involved writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.**
**> Testing - Various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements**
**> Deployment - The software is released to the users**
**> Maintenance - It entails ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment****

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**The waterfall development method follows a sequential approach with distint phases, that is - requirement, design and implementation and flows downward like a waterfall while the Agile method is iterative and incremental focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Application examples:
For waterfall - applicable in developing a basic website for a small business such as an online shop that sells perfumes
Agile - An educational online platform that offers bespoke experiences to students.**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**A Software developer writes code and is involved in the implemetation of software solutions**
**A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans**
**A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software systems**

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as *visual studio and Eclipse* are of importance in that they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code**
**Version Control Systems (VCS) including *Git and Subversion* are software tools for tracking changes in the source code and cordinating work among team members**

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**1) Tight deadlines with pressure to deliver products on shcedule often leads to rushed development and compromised quality. Such can be avoided by allocating quality time to a project with prioritization of tasks related to the project**
**2) Changing requirements during development cycle leading to delays. To help solve this, effective communication is important with a better overview of the project to avoid repetitive tasks in delivery**
**3) Technical debts accrued from shortcuts which hinders future development efforts as well as increasing maintenance costs. This can be avoided by been keep to follow the Software Development Life Cycle to ensure every step is catered for during development**

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**a) Unit testing consists of testing individual components of a software. This is of importance since it hepls in bringing to light incase one component's failure affects the functionality of the whole system.**
**b) Intergration testing involves testing interactions between different components of the system. This ensure that all the subsytems involved of in good shape to function.**
**c) System testing entails testing the enture system as a whole. This informs the general status of the software in place.**
**d) Acceptance testing is where the software is tested against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. In relation to quality assurance, this is odf importance in that it informs the reason as to why such a system was built**

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
**Prompt engineering is all about crafting clear, specific and concise questions in a way that helps get the best responses from an AI model. Prompt engineering acts as a bridge between humans and AI hence providing solutions to human-based problems.**

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague prompt - How to bake a cake.**
**Improved version - Outline a step by step procedure of how to bake a chocolate flavoured cake.**
